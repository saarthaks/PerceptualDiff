Everything in this directory (with the exception of this README) gets copied to the user's project when they run `wraith setup`.

The idea is that the user can run any of these as an example, e.g. `wraith capture configs/component.yaml`.

The configs and javascript are set up on the assumption that they are called from the directory above.
